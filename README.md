### 🤖 What Is Logistic Regression?

**Logistic Regression** is a statistical and machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems — where the output (target) is one of two possible values, like:
 
           ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail

           👍 Yes / 👎 No

           🔵 Class 0 / 🔴 Class 1


Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression one.
